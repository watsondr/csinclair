			<p>Sometimes I find it hard to talk about what I have done or what I am up to, so making a list was the best way for me.</p><br />
			<p>I live in Melbourne, Australia where I am a huge football (soccer) fan and participate actively in a growing family life. Sometimes I play video games or even read during my down time if I am not working on my personal projects.</p><br />
			<p>Please <a href="/contact" class="urlLink">come here</a> to contact me directly, I would love to talk about anything of interest or hear feedback.</p>

			<h3>Life Goals</h3>
			<p>I encountered the idea of life goals when I started researching this website. I really wanted to understand how a personal website looks and what people would expect.</p>
			<p>There are a lot of great, to the point, 1 page brochure websites out there which really dominate the scene. While definitely valuable selling tools for the owner, I don't have quite the body of work to back up a quick statement.</p>
			<p>A life goal list is simple, similar to the bucket list. It is not definitive, necessarily comprehensive or scoped, it can change and you tack on challenges along the way when new information is available. </p>
			<br />
			<p>I am attracted to the idea as it creates a public log of goals (eventually, achivements) that I find personally important or interesting. My personal appreciation is how it really underlines a person and their drives.</p>
