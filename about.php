			<h3>Life Goals</h3>
			<p>I encountered the idea of life goals when I started researching the content outside of the portfolio page for a personal website.</p>
			<p>A life goal list is simple. It is not definitive, necessarily comprehensive or scoped, it changes and I tack on challenges along the way when new information is available.</p>
			<p>I am attracted to the idea as it creates a public log of goals (eventually, achivements) that I find personally important or interesting. My personal appreciation is how it really helps display diverse accomplishments.</p>
