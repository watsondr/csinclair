Example git for my website.
I am not uploading any images used as I don't expect anyone else to use this. The repository is for demonstration of skills,
and transperency regarding evolution of my work.

This website has hosted live from 2017 to 2019. It was taken off the internet as maintaining & paying for the website stopped being a priority.
