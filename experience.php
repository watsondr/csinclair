			<p>Professionally, my main experience is in the financial and insurance sectors via IT and help desk roles.</p><br />
			<p>Largely my web or development experience is professionally exposed to small roles in projects, I have been building an understanding of code and technical concepts outside of work.</p><br />
			<p>While I was at university I did a 1 year internship at a major bank as a Business Analyst. This was active participation in the agile methodology where I could apply my system design learnings from my course &amp; the object orientated style of development, within an active software development lifecycle.
